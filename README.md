Once the basic HTML structure of the Netflix landing page is in place, the next step is to add styling to the landing page using CSS. CSS allows us to control the visual appearance of the website, including things like layout, color, and typography.
Next, we will create our CSS file. We will use some basic CSS rules in this file to style our landing page. We will also add some padding and margin properties to ensure that everything looks correct.


This will give our Netflix landing page an upgraded presentation
Step 3 (JavaScript Code):

Next, we need to add some dropdown function in JavaScript. Create a JavaScript file with the name of script.js and paste the given codes into your JavaScript file.
